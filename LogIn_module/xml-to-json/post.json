            "IntroDescription": "While small in size (and price), the AUTO550 Dual dash cam offers plenty for drivers who like a great price, and bonus features like the 32GB Endurance SD card included and monthly safety camera updates including school zones, for free. It has two cameras \u00e2\u20ac\u201c front and rear which both record in 1080P Full HD, and the front has a 130\u00c2\u00b0 field of vision which makes it perfect for recording detail without distortion. And it comes with a super long 8m cable to connect the rear camera.",
            "Overview": "The AUTO550 Dual records footage that is always GPS-tagged so you (and your insurer) will know the precise location and speed at the time of any accident. It also has a 3-Axis G-Sensor which means that it records the direction of impact. And if you are in an accident, event recording is instantly triggered so footage is automatically saved. While the 32GB Endurance SD card that comes with the device is perfect for most drivers, if you feel you need more storage, the Auto550 Dual can support a Micro SD card up to 128GB. It is installed with a super capacitor catering for fluctuations in cabin temperature and ensures reliable operation. This dash cam is also \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSmart and Low Power Parking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 compatible which means with the addition of a SmartBox (RRP $79 plus installation) as a continuous power source, it will continue to record any front motion or impact to the vehicle when the engine is switched off. Download, watch and share footage from the AUTO550 Dual via the MiVue\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Manager desktop.",
