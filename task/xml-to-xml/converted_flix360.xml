    <title>AUTO550 DUAL</title>
    <description>While small in size (and price), the AUTO550 Dual dash cam offers plenty for drivers who like a great price, and bonus features like the 32GB Endurance SD card included and monthly safety camera updates including school zones, for free. It has two cameras – front and rear which both record in 1080P Full HD, and the front has a 130° field of vision which makes it perfect for recording detail without distortion. And it comes with a super long 8m cable to connect the rear camera.</description>
